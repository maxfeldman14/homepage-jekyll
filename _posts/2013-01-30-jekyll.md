{% include JB/setup %}
I switched from RoR to Jekyll, with some help from [brandonwang.net](http://brandonwang.net), Twitter [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
Writing blog posts will be easier now.
I will eventually add images back to the site.

Costa Rica is still going well.
