#introduction
Knotty takes in an arbitrary OBJ file and output a "knotted" 
representation of it. It's modeled using a single string, and we can output 
our file to OBJ or STL for use in a rapid prototyping machine - we actually 
printed a couple final results!

#background
I took [CS285](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sequin/CS285/) in Fall 2011. 
As it was a class in 
[solid modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling) 
(the [3D Printing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3d_printing) one, not the 
[fashion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)) kind), our final 
project was to create an interesting physical object.

I created Knotty along with 
[Andrew Lee](https://plus.google.com/109776174937351700091/about), for just 
the purpose of making a really nice physical object. You can read our 
[final report](#), or view our project's 
[source](https://github.com/bmwang/knotty).

#technical
Our project was written entirely in [Python](http://python.org/). We used 
[PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) to display our results, and 
[NumPy](http://scipy.org/) for math functions.

Besides using PyOpenGL and NumPy to assist us in hardware interaction and 
math functions, we wrote the project completely from scratch. That is, we 
wrote an [OBJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file)/
[STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) reader/writer, our own 
voxel file format, and a sweep program, in addition to our algorithm.

So the first thing we do is load the input OBJ. We then create an 
axis-aligned [voxel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) grid with a 
user-specified resolution, and mark a voxel as 
"full" when a triangle exists with in it, and empty otherwise. Note that this 
is not a _space-filling_ voxelization. Because we are only making a knot of 
the object's outer surface, we only need the outer voxels.

Once we have the outer voxels, we view each as a cube, and select only the 
outwards-facing faces of each cube. This can now be viewed as a "blocky" 
quadrilateralization of the original input. 

We then create a large graph of each connecting face. That is, each face 
becomes a node that can reference the nodes next to them. Because each face 
has four faces connected to it due to our voxelization, we can say each node 
has [valence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)) four. 
Because each node is valence four, an 
[Eulerian cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_cycle) is 
guaranteed to exist. An Eulerian cycle is a path through a graph that visits
every edge once.

We find an Eulerian cycle through the nodes using a modified 
[Hierholzer's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path#Hierholzer.27s_algorithm). 
The algorithm is mostly the same, but we give preference to paths that are kept 
mostly straight.

This Eulerian cycle is converted into [b-splines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) 
by creating control points in 
one of a three predetermined cases. Connecting the splines together, we obtain 
a geometrically and parametrically continuous. Since the Eulerian cycle wraps 
back onto itself, there is no set beginning or end, so the resulting b-spline is 
a single loop through the entire shape. The b-spline is sampled using
[De Casteljau's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm).

We then create a sweep through the b-spline, meaning that we trace a 2D 
cross-section through the b-spline to make a 3D representation. We used a 
rotation minimizing frame to remove inflection and keep the mesh well behaved. 
In the case of our project, we used another b-spline to define a circular 
cross-section to look like string. The output is a watertight closed manifold, 
and we output it to OBJ or STL for use with a [FDM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling).
