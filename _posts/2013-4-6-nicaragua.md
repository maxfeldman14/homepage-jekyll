###Costa Rica
We probably did some stuff leading up to Semana Santa (like a Fatboy Slim concert- pretty fun).

But for Semana Santa we went to Nicaragua.

The first two nights we spent in San Juan del Sur.
It was a pleasant beach town.
The second day we were there we went on a sailing trip to a secluded beach.
It was relaxing.
Earlier in the day a couple of us played a game of beach soccer with some locals (I asked to play waiter, and ony realized the next day that I messed up saying "goalie").

The following day we we went to La Isla Ometepe for two nights.
The second day we went for a volcano hike, but ran out of water and finished halfway through.
It was still enjoyable and had a good view.

After La Isla, we went to Leon.
The first night we just hung out.
The second day we walked around and went volcano boarding (sledding down the volcano).
Volcano boarding was pretty fun.
The next day I helped translate for a friend in the hospital.
Everything was fast and free- it was a great medical experience.

After Leon, we went to Managua so most of the group could catch the bus.
I caught a different bus and eventually made it to La Isla Ometepe (again) to see a friend.
The travel was long, but interesting.
When I left La Isla for the final time, right as we were about to dock, a large wave splashed me and soaked all of my stuff (and myself).
Unfortunately, I also think that I left my camera on the island.
The following day, a small group of us went to Masaya (but the market was closed).
From Masaya, myself and another man went to Managua.

I caught a bus back the following morning, which only took about 9 hours.
The buses were very interesting (they are called chicken buses, and are basically old school buses but packed wall-to-wall with people).
It was an interesting experience, but I eventually made it back to San Jose.


###Technical stuff
Too hectic of a couple weeks for anything technical.
