A few weekends ago I went to the Osa Peninsula, to Puerto Jimenez (and later Corcovado National Park).
We stayed in a hostel which was surrounded by jungle, which proved to be very interesting.
One day there was a scorpion in the shower, another day a tree frog.
We often woke up to the sound of howler monkeys, and it was quite the experience.

One day we went to a beach which was very pleasant until our friend was stung by a jellyfish.
Another day we went on a nature hike and saw several interesting animals (including toucans, parrots, tree frogs, and other colorful creatures).
Unfortunately this hike also resulted in myself and another hiker stepping through fire ants and being stung repeatedly.

Later, we left Puerto Jimenez for Corcovado National park.
The park was beautiful, though unfortunately I didn't have time to stay the night in the park and had to turn back during the day.
I got lost on the way back but eventually found the trail.
