###Costa Rica
Since the last post I have done a bit of travelling.

We rented a car for a weekend and went to La Fortuna/Arenal and Monteverde.
These were both fun, although actually driving was a bit stressful.
In La Fortuna we went to a hot spring area that was under a bridge on the side of the road somewhere.
It was fun, but also dark.

We later went to Monteverde, and went on a night tour and saw some flora and fauna (including, but not limited to: sloths, spiders, rodents, and trees).
The following morning we went on a canopy tour, which included zip lining and general excitement.
It was cold and rainy, but still enjoyable.
We later went to a museum of bats and learned about bats.
We then saw some bats, and while no one was looking I snuck one into my backpack (note: I did not actually do this).
We returned to San Jose on Sunday evening.

On Monday I left for Puerto Viejo (on the Atlantic side of Costa Rica).
We spent a night there (it was cloudy and a bit rainy, unfortunately), and then went to Bocas del Toro, Panama.
The weather was about the same in Bocas del Toro, but it was fun.
I left straight from Bocas del Toro for San Jose so I could work on some things.

The past week has been a welcome week to UCR, with concerts and other activities.
This has been fun.

###Technical stuff
I still haven't really gotten around to making this blog more readable or usable.
