###Costa Rica
Costa Rica continues to go well.
I'm continuing to work and do classes and the usual stuff.

The most recent adventure was a weekend trip to the [Best Fest](www.thebestfestival.com), a music festival near Uvita.
We stayed in a hostel in Domincal, and then went to the festival.
I believe the actual festival was at Costa Ballena or something, and it had a very nice beach nearby.
The transportation infrastructure of the festival was a bit lacking, and when we wanted to leave on the first night there were no taxis to be found.
We tried for a while to call for a taxi but were unsuccessful.
Eventually a pickup truck taxi showed up, so we used that (it also turned out to be a pirate taxi).
I rode in the truck bed with a couple people and we were able to watch the stars as we drove, which was fun.
Eventually we made it back to the hostel and went to Manuel Antonio the following day.

More recently I went to Rio Celeste, which was very beautiful.
Some chemicals in the water make the river appear blue at certain points.
There were also hot springs.
The trip involved about 10-12 hours of driving, but it was well worth it.

The following day there was an electronic music festival closer to San Jose centro, and I stopped by for about 10 minutes.

###Technical stuff
I am currently looking into the best/easiest way to include pictures in this blog, and perhaps upload whole albums.
I may use dropbox for storage and provide links to the albums.

I also recently gave a presentation on Alan Turing for my Spanish class, and spent a while trying to explain Turing machines in Spanish, which was fun.
