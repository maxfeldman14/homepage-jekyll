#### Hi, I'm Max Feldman.

I am a senior EECS student at UC Berkeley (although I am currently studying abroad in Costa Rica). My focus within EECS is computer science, with a particular interest in computer security. 

I am currently involved in various research and work [projects]. I have spent the past two summers interning at [Salesforce.com]. I am enthusiastic about exploring the many facets of computer security, and in addition to my network security research I've begun to look into web application security and applied cryptography.

I've had the privilege of working on UC Berkeley's [computer security] and [software engineering] courses in the SP12 semester, and will continue to participate in the FA12 semester.

In my free time I enjoy playing and writing music, rock climbing, and learning new (human) languages.
